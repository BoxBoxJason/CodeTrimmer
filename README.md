# Code Trimmer
User friendly tool to cleanup your project folders/files.

### Removes trailing whitespaces at the end of every line of your code for increased readability.

Requires only one argument: the path (absolute or relative) to source folder/file that needs to be trimmed.

### ATTENTION:
Works with Python 3.6 and up.<br/>
**Be careful, there will be no confirmation message and changes cannot be undone.**

### LAUNCH:
```
python CodeTrimmer [source folder/file path]
```
